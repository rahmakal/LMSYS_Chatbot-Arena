# Chatbot Arena Preference Prediction

This project aims to predict which chatbot responses users will prefer in head-to-head battles between different large language models (LLMs).
The dataset contains conversations from the Chatbot Arena, featuring user prompts, responses from two competing models, and labels indicating user preferences.
