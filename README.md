# Chatbot Arena Preference Prediction

This project aims to predict which chatbot responses users will prefer in head-to-head battles between different large language models (LLMs). The dataset is derived from conversations in the Chatbot Arena, where various LLMs generate responses to user prompts.

The dataset contains conversations from the Chatbot Arena, featuring user prompts, responses from two competing models, and labels indicating user preferences.
